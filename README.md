# School Website
status: WIP
 
This is a completely unoptimized alternate version of the school website. It is not optimized in any sort of way, so it's not usable in production.

Right now it's just an experiment in css.

Done:
- Initial website
- MUI rewrite
- Add content

Todo:
- Improve content
- Add Photo page
- Finish modular components

Future goals:
- Integrate with PocketBase
- Web Untis Integration
- Color Scheme
- Dark mode
- Make design responsive
- Finish the website
- Optimize for production
